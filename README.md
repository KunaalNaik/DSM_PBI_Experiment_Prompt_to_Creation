Given that you're targeting roles in Power BI development and data analysis within the eCommerce marketing domain, I recommend focusing on the **Marketing Channel Effectiveness Dashboard**. This project will allow you to demonstrate:

- Your ability to analyze various marketing channels, essential in eCommerce.
- The integration of data from different platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, email marketing tools, etc.
- Your understanding of key marketing metrics that are crucial for optimizing ad spend and improving ROI.

Make sure to include insightful visualizations and a well-thought-out layout that caters to the needs of a marketing team. Including some predictive analytics, such as forecasting future channel performance based on historical data, could further enhance your portfolio's appeal.

## Step 2 : Generate Data

Certainly! We will generate a dataset with at least 1000 rows, allowing you to calculate the specified metrics when creating the dashboard. We'll structure the data to closely resemble real-world scenarios in the eCommerce marketing domain.

### Data Structure
We'll create a single table with the following columns:

- **Date**: Specific dates for the observations.
- **Channel**: The marketing channel (Social Media, Email, SEO, PPC).
- **Impressions**: The number of times the ad was shown.
- **Clicks**: The number of times the ad was clicked.
- **Conversions**: The number of successful conversions (e.g., purchases) after clicking the ad.
- **Ad Spend**: The amount spent on advertising for each channel.
- **Revenue**: The revenue generated from conversions.

From this data, you'll be able to calculate the following metrics:
- **Channel-wise Traffic**: Calculate from the "Clicks" column, segmented by the channel.
- **Cost per Click (CPC)**: Divide "Ad Spend" by "Clicks."
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: Divide "Revenue" by "Ad Spend."
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Divide "Clicks" by "Impressions."
- **Conversion Rate by Channel**: Divide "Conversions" by "Clicks."
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Divide "Ad Spend" by "Conversions."

### Generating the Data

Let's create a dataset with these columns and export it to an Excel file.

~~~
# Number of rows
num_rows = 1000

# Generating data
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', periods=num_rows),
    'Channel': np.random.choice(channels, num_rows),
    'Impressions': np.random.randint(1000, 5000, num_rows),
    'Clicks': np.random.randint(100, 1000, num_rows),
    'Conversions': np.random.randint(10, 100, num_rows),
    'Ad Spend': np.random.uniform(500, 2000, num_rows),
    'Revenue': np.random.uniform(1000, 5000, num_rows)
}

# Creating DataFrame
marketing_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# File path
marketing_file_path = '/mnt/data/marketing_channel_data.xlsx'

# Saving to Excel
with pd.ExcelWriter(marketing_file_path) as writer:
    marketing_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Marketing Data', index=False)
~~~

The fake data for the Marketing Channel Effectiveness Dashboard has been generated, and the file has been saved as an Excel file. This dataset includes 1000 rows and contains realistic attributes that will allow you to calculate the specified metrics.
